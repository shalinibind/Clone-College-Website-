    The department of Mechanical Engineering has come into existence, since the inception of the college, in the year 1985. Present intake of students for B.Tech. program is 180 and 18 for each of M. Tech. programs viz., M. Tech. in CAD/CAM and Thermal Sciences and Energy Systems. The Department is fortified with 36 teaching faculty and 16 supporting staff.  Twelve of the faculty members possess Ph. D. degrees; eight faulty members are pursuing for their Ph. D. degrees, and the rest of the faculty members are with M. E. /  M. Tech. degrees.
</p><p>
The department is equipped with twelve well established labs that give hands on practical knowledge in the subjects. The department also runs PLM- Excellent centre that trains the final year B. tech. students in PLM software. A research lab on Composites testing is established to promote research in that area. APSSDC has sanctioned Siemens skill development center under which, CNC center and Manufacturing welding labs were established, in which, students from Polytechnics and Vocational courses are trained. Relevant licensed softwares like PLM, MAT Lab, Design Expert, Auto CAD, ANSYS Work Bench, CATIA R12, Uni-Graphics NX2.0, Solid Edge V14, CADian, Mechanical Desktop, Inventor-6, Esprit CAM, and Master CAM have been catering to the needs of students and faculty.</p>
