    The department is one of the three departments with which the college was established in the academic year 1984-85 with intake strength of 60 per batch, now it is increased to 120 per batch . The Department is having M.Tech course with Structural Engineering as Specialization.The department is having all necessary labs with good equipment required for UG students. The department produced a large number of qualified engineers, majority of whom settled well in India and abroad. The scheme of instruction and syllabi of subjects are revised at regular intervals to incorporate the latest topics as per the needs of Civil Engineering Profession, such as Auto CAD, STAAD, Remote Sensing and GIS etc.</p>
