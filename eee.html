    The department of EEE was established in 1994 with the aim of importing high quality technical education in the area of Electrical and Electronics Engineering with an intake of 60. The intake was increased to 120 from 2008 and is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Anantapur, Ananthapuramu. The department is headed by Dr. T. Bramhananda Reddy. The department has a strong pool of faculty with 14 Ph.D.'s and 7 M.Tech's. It boasts of having highly qualified faculty with an unparalleled level of expertise in their field. The pure expertise and dedication of the faculty members along with infrastructural facilities coupled with perseverance of the students have catapulted the branch to the top league. Break up of teaching staff is 3 Professors, 11 Associate Professors and 7 Assistant Professors.  Active research is going on in the areas of Power Systems, Power Electronics & Drives and Control Systems.
