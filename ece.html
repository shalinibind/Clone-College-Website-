<p>The ECE dept. was established in the academic year 1984-85 with an intake of 40 and currently with 180 regular and 36 lateral entry students. The department is also offering two post graduate programme with the specialization of Communications and Signal Processing and VLSI Embedded systems with an intake of 18 students.
</p><p>
The department has highly qualified faculty having specialized in diversified areas of technology like Communications, Signal Processing, Microelectronics, Microprocessors, Instrumentation and control and Digital Electronics. The department is well equipped and has excellent laboratory facilities.</p>
<p>
With the idea of “disseminating Knowledge through interaction”, department has been organizing National Level Technical Symposiums for the past three years through the constant support and enthusiasm of the management, faculty and students.</p>
